# Predicting propery tax assessed values of Single Family Properties

- project description with goals

    The goal of this project is to find the key drivers of property tax value for single family properties that had a transaction in 2017. The scenario is that a Zillow Data Science Team has a model ready, but they are looking for insights that can help improve it. This project will give recommendations on a way to make a better model. It will also give me an opportunity to practice the data science pipeline to include Acquire, Prepare, Exploring, and Modeling.


initial hypotheses:

### $H_0$: there is no relationship between tax values and number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square_feet
### $H_a$: There is a relationship between tax values and number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square_feet
