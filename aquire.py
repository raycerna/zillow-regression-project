# SQL CONNECTION
def get_db_url(db_name):

    '''
    Connect to the SQL database with credentials stored in env file.
    Function parameter is the name of the database to connect to.
    Returns url.
    '''
    
    # Creates the url and the function returns this url
    url = f'mysql+pymysql://{username}:{password}@{host}/{db_name}'

# ACQUIRE
def get_zillow_data():

    '''
    Connect to SQL Database with url function called within this function.
    Checks if database is already saved to computer in csv file.
    If no file found, saves to a csv file and assigns database to df variable.
    If file found, just assigns database to df variable.
    Returns df variable holding the  Home Value database.
    Includes all 52 Columns.
